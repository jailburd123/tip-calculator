# Tip Calulator App

We will be building out a Tip calculator app that will take in the following properties:

- an item add/delete button
- a item price box
- an item count tally
- the name of our fake resturant
- a Subtotal
- a gratuity form that is in %
- a total after our gratuity has been added
- a pay button, and if pay is not totaling the amount owed, to give other options to accept payment
